# Airbnb Looker Studio Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involves data preparation (cleaning, wrangling) and dashboard building. The dataset contains information on Airbnb listings from New York City, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata?resource=download&ref=hackernoon.com). The goal of this project is to build a dashboard in Looker Studio that operates similar to the Airbnb website, helping those looking for a place to stay find those right for them (price, location, quality, etc). 

Included in this repository are the following:

  - Jupyter Notebook file - downloading data, cleaning, and wrangling to prepare for dashboard usage.
  - Looker Studio dashboard screenshot (you can access the dashboard [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/0dc7c279-372f-4b6c-85f5-d6a465803bed/page/ET9DE).
